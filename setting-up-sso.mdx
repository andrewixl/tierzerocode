Identity providers allow your users to log into Tier Zero Code using their existing accounts from external identity systems like Microsoft Entra (Google & Okta coming soon). Instead of creating separate local accounts, users can authenticate with their familiar work or personal credentials.

## Supported Identity Providers

These providers can be used to connect and log in to Tier Zero Code:

- Microsoft Entra ID
- Google Workspace (Coming Soon)
- Okta (Coming Soon)

## Microsoft Entra ID

Integrate with Microsoft’s enterprise identity platform to allow users to authenticate using their Microsoft Entra ID Directory accounts. Ideal for organizations using Microsoft 365 or other Azure services, providing seamless single sign-on across your Microsoft ecosystem.

## Google Workspace (Coming Soon)

Easily set up Google Workspace authentication for your organization. Users can sign in with their Google accounts and access Tier Zero Code using their existing Google credentials. Perfect for organizations already using Google Workspace for email, calendar, and other services.

## Okta (Coming Soon)

Extend the security and convenience of your app by integrating with Okta. Users will be able to authenticate using their familiar Okta credentials – ideal for organizations leveraging Okta for single sign-on and robust identity management.
